# Jason_URL_Shortener
 Jason's URL Shortener is a simple, efficient, and customizable web-based application for shortening long URLs and managing their expiration time. Built with a FastAPI backend and a static HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend, this project allows users to create shortened links and set an optional expiration time, after which the link becomes inaccessible.
